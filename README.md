# Data-Analysis
The dataset contains data coming from a battery installed in a telecom tower. There are different values related to a battery but the first column is timestamp.  
The goal is to find correlation between two pair of values and to visualise the correlation between them.

1.Pair 1 between Grid Status and SOC
2.Pair 2 between Equivalent cycles and SOH
3.Pair 3 between SOC and temperature
